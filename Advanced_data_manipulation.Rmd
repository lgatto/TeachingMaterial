## Setting up some options

Let's first turn on the cache for increased performance.
```{r, cache=FALSE}
library(knitr)
# Set some global knitr options
library("knitr")
opts_chunk$set(tidy=TRUE, tidy.opts=list(blank=FALSE, width.cutoff=80),cache=TRUE)

```

## Motivation

- R has pass-by-value semantics, which minimizes accidental side effects. However, this can become a major bottleneck when dealing with large datasets both in terms of memory and speed.

- Working with `data.frame`s in R can also be painful process in terms of writing code.

- Fortunately, R provides some solution to this problems.

## Overview

Here we will review three R packages that can be used to provide efficient data manipulation:

- `data.table`: An package for efficient data storage and manipulation
- `RSQLite`: Database Interface R driver for SQLite
- `sqldf`: An R package for runing SQL statements on R data frames, optimized for convenience

## What is data.table?

`data.table` is an R package that extends. `R` `data.frame`s.

Under the hood, they are just `data.frame's, with some extra 'stuff' added on.
So, they're collections of equal-length vectors. Each vector can be of different type.

```{r}
library(data.table)
dt <- data.table(x=1:3, y=c(4, 5, 6), z=letters[1:3])
dt
class(dt)
```

The extra functionality offered by `data.table` allows us to modify, reshape, and merge `data.table`s much quicker than `data.frame`s. **See that `data.table` inherits from `data.frame`!**

## Installing data.table

- stable CRAN release
    
    
```{r eval=FALSE}
# Only install if not already installed. 
require(data.table) || install.packages("data.table")
```
- latest bug-fixes + enhancements (No need to do that, we will use the stable release)
```{r eval=FALSE}
library(devtools)
install_github("Rdatatable/data.table", build_vignettes = FALSE)
```


## What's different?

Most of your interactions with `data.table`s will be through the subset (`[`)
operator, which behaves quite differently for `data.table`s. We'll examine
a few of the common cases.

Visit [this stackoverflow question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13618488/what-you-can-do-with-data-frame-that-you-cant-in-data-table) for a summary of the differences between `data.frame`s and `data.table`s.

## Single element subsetting

```{r}
library(data.table)
DF <- data.frame(x=1:3, y=4:6, z=7:9)
DT <- data.table(x=1:3, y=4:6, z=7:9)
DF[c(2,3)]
DT[c(2,3)]
```

By default, single-element subsetting in `data.table`s refers to rows, rather
than columns.

## Row subsetting

```{r}
library(data.table)
DF <- data.frame(x=1:3, y=4:6, z=7:9)
DT <- data.table(x=1:3, y=4:6, z=7:9)
DF[c(2,3), ]
DT[c(2,3), ]
```

Notice: row names are lost with `data.table`s. Otherwise, output is identical.

## Column subsetting

```{r}
library(data.table)
DF <- data.frame(x=1:3, y=4:6, z=7:9)
DT <- data.table(x=1:3, y=4:6, z=7:9)
DF[, c(2,3)]
DT[, c(2,3)]
```

`DT[, c(2,3)]` just returns `c(2, 3)`. Why on earth is that?

## The j expression

The subset operator is really a function, and `data.table` modifies it to behave
differently.

Call the arguments we pass e.g. `DT[i, j]`, or `DT[i]`.

The second argument to `[` is called the `j expression`, so-called because it's
interpreted as an `R` expression. This is where most of the `data.table`
magic happens.

`j` is an expression evaluated within the frame of the `data.table`, so
it sees the column names of `DT`. Similarly for `i`.

First, let's remind ourselves what an `R` expression is.


## Expressions

An `expression` is a collection of statements, enclosed in a block generated by
braces `{}`.

```{r}
## an expression with two statements
{
  x <- 1
  y <- 2
}
## the last statement in an expression is returned
k <- { print(10); 5 }
print(k)
```

## The j expression

So, `data.table` does something special with the `expression` that you pass as
`j`, the second argument, to the subsetting (`[`) operator.

The return type of the final statement in our expression determines the type
of operation that will be performed.

In general, the output should either be a `list` of symbols, or a statement
using `:=`.

We'll start by looking at the `list` of symbols as an output.

## An example

When we simply provide a `list` to the `j expression`, we generate a new
`data.table` as output, with operations as performed within the `list` call.

```{r}
library(data.table)
DT <- data.table(x=1:5, y=1:5)
DT[, list(mean_x = mean(x), sum_y = sum(y), sumsq=sum(x^2+y^2))]
```

Notice how the symbols `x` and `y` are looked up within the `data.table` `DT`.
No more writing `DT$` everywhere!


## Using :=

Using the `:=` operator tells us we should assign columns by reference into
the `data.table` `DT`:

```{r}
library(data.table)
DT <- data.table(x=1:5)
DT[, y := x^2]
```

## Using := 

By default, `data.table`s are not copied on a direct assignment `<-`:

```{r}
library(data.table)
DT <- data.table(x=1)
DT2 <- DT
DT[, y := 2]
DT2
```

Notice that `DT2` has changed. This is something to be mindful of; if you want
to explicitly copy a `data.table` do so with `DT2 <- copy(DT)`.

## A slightly more complicated example

```{r}
library(data.table)
DT <- data.table(x=1:5, y=6:10, z=11:15)
DT[, m := log2( (x+1) / (y+1) )]
```


## Using an expression in j

Note that the right-hand side of a `:=` call can be an expression.

```{r}
library(data.table)
DT <- data.table(x=1:5, y=6:10, z=11:15)
DT[, m := { tmp <- (x + 1) / (y + 1); log2(tmp) }]
```

## Multiple returns in j

The left hand side of a `:=` call can also be a character vector of names,
for which the corresponding final statement in the `j expression` should be
a list of the same length.

```{r}
library(data.table)
DT <- data.table(x=1:5, y=6:10, z=11:15)
DT[, c('m', 'n') := { tmp <- (x + 1) / (y + 1); list( log2(tmp), log10(tmp) ) }]
DT[, `:=`(a=x^2, b=y^2)]
DT[, c("c","d"):=list(x^2, y^2)]
```

## The j expression revisited

So, we typically call `j` the `j expression`, but really, it's either:

1. An expression, or

2. A call to the function `:=`, for which the first argument is a set of
names (vectors to update), and the second argument is an expression, with
the final statement typically being a list of results to assign within
the `data.table`.

As I said before, `a := b` is parsed by `R` as `":="(a, b)`, hence it
looking somewhat like an operator.

```{r}
quote(a := b)
```

## Why does it matter?

Whenever you sub-assign a `data.frame`, `R` is forced to copy the entire
`data.frame`.

That is, whenever you write `DF$x <- 1`, `DF["x"] <- 1`, `DF[["x"]] <- 1`...

... R will make a copy of `DF` before assignment.

This is done in order to ensure any other symbols pointing at the same object
do not get modified. This is a good thing for when we need to reason about
the code we write, since, in general, we expect `R` to operate without side 
effects.

Unfortunately, it is prohibitively slow for large objects, and hence why
`:=` can be very useful.

## Why does it matter?

```{r}
library(data.table); library(microbenchmark)
big_df <- data.frame(x=rnorm(1E6), y=sample(letters, 1E6, TRUE))
big_dt <- data.table(big_df)
microbenchmark( big_df$z <- 1, big_dt[, z := 1] )
```

Once again, notice that `:=` is actually a function, and `z := 1` 
is parsed as `":="(z, 1)`.

## Using by

We can also perform grouping like operations through the use of the
`by` argument:

```{r}
library(data.table)
DT <- data.table(x=1:5, y=6:10, gp=c('a', 'a', 'a', 'b', 'b'))
DT[, z := mean(x+y), by=gp]
```

Notice that since `mean(x+y)` returns a scalar (numeric vector of length 1), it is recycled to fill within each group.

## Generating a new data.table

What if, rather than modifying the current `data.table`, we wanted to generate
a new one?

```{r}
library(data.table)
DT <- data.table(x=1:5, y=6:10, gp=c('a', 'a', 'a', 'b', 'b'))
DT[, list(z=mean(x + y)), by=gp]
```

Notice that we retain one row for each unique group specified in the `by`
argument, and only the `by` variables along-side our `z` variable are returned.

## The j expression

- A `list`

... returns a new `data.table`, potentially subset over groups in your `by`.

- A `:=` Call

... modifies that `data.table` in place, hence saving memory. Output is
recycled if the `by` argument is used.

#### In general, our `j expression` is either:

2. an expression, with the final (or only) statement being a `list` of (named) 
  arguments,

3. a call to the `:=` function, with
  * the first argument being names, and
  * the second argument being an expression, for which the last statement is
  a list of the same length as the first argument.



## Special variables

There are a number of special variables defined only within `j`, that allow us to do some neat things...

```{r}
library(data.table)
data.table()[, ls(all=TRUE)]
```

These variables allow us to infer a bit more about what's going on within the
`data.table` calls, and also allow us to write more complicated `j expression`s.


## Special variables

### `.SD`

A `data.table` containing the subset of data for each group, excluding
columns used in `by`.

### `.BY`

A ` list` containing a length 1 vector for each item in `by`.

### `.N`


## Special variables

An integer, length 1, containing the number of rows in `.SD`.

### `.I`

A vector of indices, holding the row locations from which `.SD` was
pulled from the parent `DT`.

### `.GRP`

A counter telling you which group you're working with (1st, 2nd, 3rd...)

## Example usage of .N - Counts

Compute the counts, by group, using `data.table`...
```{r}
set.seed(123); library(data.table); library(microbenchmark)
DT <- data.table(x=sample(letters[1:3], 1E5, TRUE))
DT[, .N, by=x]
table(DT$x)
```

## Example usage of .N - Counts


```{r}
library(data.table)
library(microbenchmark)
DT <- data.table(x=factor(sample(letters[1:3], 1E5, TRUE)))
microbenchmark( tbl=table(DT$x), DT=DT[, .N, by=x] )
```

## Example usage of .SD - lapply-type calls

```{r}
library(data.table)
DT <- data.table(x=rnorm(10), y=rnorm(10), z=rnorm(10), id=letters[1:10])
DT[, lapply(.SD, mean), .SDcols=c('x', 'y', 'z')]
lapply(DT[,1:3, with=FALSE], mean)
```

## Example usage of .SD - lapply-type calls

```{r, cache=TRUE}
library(data.table); library(microbenchmark)
DT <- data.table(x=rnorm(1E5), y=rnorm(1E5), z=sample(letters,1E5,replace=TRUE))
DT2 <- copy(DT)
setkey(DT2, "z")
microbenchmark(
  DT=DT[, lapply(.SD, mean), .SDcols=c('x', 'y'), by='z'],
  DT2=DT2[, lapply(.SD, mean), .SDcols=c('x', 'y'), by='z']
)
```

setting a key can lead to faster grouping operations. 

## Keys

`data.table`s can be keyed, allowing for faster indexing and subsetting. Keys
are also used for `join`s, as we'll see later.

```{r}
library(data.table)
DT <- data.table(x=c('a', 'a', 'b', 'c', 'a'), y=rnorm(5))
setkey(DT, x)
DT['a'] ## grabs rows corresponding to 'a'
```

Note that this does a `binary search` rather than a `vector scan`, which is
much faster!

## Key performance

```{r, cache=TRUE}
library(data.table); library(microbenchmark)
DF <- data.frame(key=sample(letters, 1E6, TRUE), x=rnorm(1E6))
DT <- data.table(DF)
setkey(DT, key)
identical( DT['a']$x, DF[ DF$key == 'a', ]$x )
microbenchmark( DT=DT['a'], DF=DF[ DF$key == 'a', ], times=5 )
```

Further reading: you can set multiple keys with `setkeyv` as well.

## Joins

`data.table` comes with many kinds of joins, implements through the 
`merge.data.table` function, and also through the `[` syntax as well. We'll
focus on using `merge`.

```{r}
library(data.table); library(microbenchmark)
DT1 <- data.table(x=c('a', 'a', 'b', 'dt1'), y=1:4)
DT2 <- data.table(x=c('a', 'b', 'dt2'), z=5:7)
setkey(DT1, x)
setkey(DT2, x)
merge(DT1, DT2)
```

## Overview of joins

Here is a quick summary of SQL joins, applicable to `data.table` too.


(Source: http://www.codeproject.com)

<img src="http://www.codeproject.com/KB/database/Visual_SQL_Joins/Visual_SQL_JOINS_orig.jpg" width="600">

## A left join

```{r}
library(data.table); library(microbenchmark)
DT1 <- data.table(x=c('a', 'a', 'b', 'dt1'), y=1:4)
DT2 <- data.table(x=c('a', 'b', 'dt2'), z=5:7)
setkey(DT1, x)
setkey(DT2, x)
merge(DT1, DT2, all.x=TRUE)
```

## A right join

```{r}
library(data.table); library(microbenchmark)
DT1 <- data.table(x=c('a', 'a', 'b', 'dt1'), y=1:4)
DT2 <- data.table(x=c('a', 'b', 'dt2'), z=5:7)
setkey(DT1, x)
setkey(DT2, x)
merge(DT1, DT2, all.y=TRUE)
```

## An outer join

```{r}
library(data.table); library(microbenchmark)
DT1 <- data.table(x=c('a', 'a', 'b', 'dt1'), y=1:4)
DT2 <- data.table(x=c('a', 'b', 'dt2'), z=5:7)
setkey(DT1, x)
setkey(DT2, x)
merge(DT1, DT2, all=TRUE) ## outer join
```

## An inner join

```{r}
library(data.table); library(microbenchmark)
DT1 <- data.table(x=c('a', 'a', 'b', 'dt1'), y=1:4)
DT2 <- data.table(x=c('a', 'b', 'dt2'), z=5:7)
setkey(DT1, x)
setkey(DT2, x)
merge(DT1, DT2, all=FALSE) ## inner join
```


## Speed example

```{r, cache=TRUE}
library(data.table); library(microbenchmark)
DT1 <- data.table(
  x=do.call(paste, expand.grid(letters, letters, letters, letters)), 
  y=rnorm(26^4)
)
DT2 <- DT1[ sample(1:nrow(DT1), 1E5), ]
setnames(DT2, c('x', 'z'))
DF1 <- as.data.frame(DT1)
DF2 <- as.data.frame(DT2)
setkey(DT1, x); setkey(DT2, x)
microbenchmark( DT=merge(DT1, DT2), DF=merge.data.frame(DF1, DF2), replications=5)
```

## Subset joins

We can also perform joins of two keyed `data.table`s using the `[` operator.
We perform right joins, so that e.g.

- `DT1[DT2]`

is a right join of `DT1` into `DT2`. These joins are typically a bit faster. Do
note that the order of columns post-merge can be different, though.

## Subset joins

```{r}
library(data.table); library(microbenchmark)
DT1 <- data.table(
  x=do.call(paste, expand.grid(letters, letters, letters, letters)), 
  y=rnorm(26^4)
)
DT2 <- DT1[ sample(1:nrow(DT1), 1E5), ]
setnames(DT2, c('x', 'z'))
setkey(DT1, x); setkey(DT2, x)
tmp1 <- DT2[DT1]
setcolorder(tmp1, c('x', 'y', 'z'))
tmp2 <- merge(DT1, DT2, all.x=TRUE)
setcolorder(tmp2, c('x', 'y', 'z'))
identical(tmp1, tmp2)
```

## Subset joins can be faster

```{r}
library(data.table); library(microbenchmark)
DT1 <- data.table(
  x=do.call(paste, expand.grid(letters, letters, letters, letters)), 
  y=rnorm(26^4)
)
DT2 <- DT1[ sample(1:nrow(DT1), 1E5), ]
setnames(DT2, c('x', 'z'))
setkey(DT1, x); setkey(DT2, x)
microbenchmark( bracket=DT1[DT2], merge=merge(DT1, DT2, all.y=TRUE), times=5 )
```

## Subset joins and the j-expression

More importantly they can be used the j-expression simultaneously, which can be very convenient. 

```{r}
DT1 <- data.table(x=1:5, y=6:10, z=11:15, key="x")
DT2 <- data.table(x=2L, y=7, w=1L, key="x")
# 1) subset only essential/necessary cols
DT1[DT2, list(z)]
# 2) create new col, i.y refer's to DT2's y col
DT1[DT2, list(newcol = y > i.y)]  
# 3) also assign by reference with `:=`
DT1[DT2, newcol := z-w]
```

## data.table and SQL

We can understand the usage of `[` as SQL statements. 
From [FAQ 2.16](http://datatable.r-forge.r-project.org/datatable-faq.pdf):

data.table Argument | SQL Statement
 ---|---
i | WHERE
j | SELECT
:= | UPDATE
by | GROUP BY
i | ORDER BY (in compound syntax)
i | HAVING (in compound syntax)

Compound syntax refers to multiple subsetting calls, and generally isn't
necessary until you really feel like a `data.table` expert:

    DT[where,select|update,group by][having][order by][ ]...[ ]

## data.table and SQL - Joins

Here is a quick summary table of joins in `data.table`.


SQL | data.table
 ---|---
LEFT JOIN | x[y]
RIGHT JOIN | y[x]
INNER JOIN | x[y, nomatch=0]
OUTER JOIN | merge(x,y,all=TRUE)

## data.table and SQL

It's worth noting that I really mean it when I say that `data.table` is like
an in-memory data base. It will even perform some basic query optimization!

```{r}
library(data.table)
options(datatable.verbose=TRUE)
DT <- data.table(x=1:5, y=1:5, z=1:5, a=c('a', 'a', 'b', 'b', 'c'))
DT[, lapply(.SD, mean), by=a]
options(datatable.verbose=FALSE)
```


## Some thoughts

The primary use of `data.table` is for efficient and **elegant** data manipulation including aggregation and joins. 

```{r}
library(data.table); library(microbenchmark)
DT <- data.table(gp1=sample(letters, 1E6, TRUE), gp2=sample(LETTERS, 1E6, TRUE), y=rnorm(1E6))
microbenchmark( times=5,
  DT=DT[, mean(y), by=list(gp1, gp2)],
  DF=with(DT, tapply(y, paste(gp1, gp2), mean)))
```

Unlike "split-apply-combine" approaches such as `plyr`, data is never split in `data.table`! `data.table` applies the function to each subset recursively (in C for speed). This keeps the memory footprint low - which is very essential for "big data". 

## Other interesting convenience functions

- `like`

```{r like}
DT = data.table(Name=c("Mary","George","Martha"), Salary=c(2,3,4))
# Use regular expressions
DT[Name %like% "^Mar"]
```

- `set*` functions
`set`, `setattr`, `setnames`, `setcolorder`, `setkey`, `setkeyv`

```{r set}
setcolorder(DT, c("Salary", "Name"))
DT
```


- `DT[, (myvar):=NULL]` remove a column

```{r NULL}
DT[,Name:=NULL]
```


## Bonuses: fread

`data.table` also comes with `fread`, a file reader much, much better than
`read.table` or `read.csv`:

```{r}
library(data.table); library(microbenchmark)
big_df <- data.frame(x=rnorm(1E6), y=rnorm(1E6))
file <- tempfile()
write.table(big_df, file=file, row.names=FALSE, col.names=TRUE, sep="\t", quote=FALSE)
microbenchmark( fread=fread(file), r.t=read.table(file, header=TRUE, sep="\t"), times=1 )
unlink(file)
```

## Bonuses: rbindlist

Use this function to `rbind` a list of `data.frame`s, `data.table`s or `list`s:

```{r}
library(data.table); library(microbenchmark)
dfs <- replicate(100, data.frame(x=rnorm(1E4), y=rnorm(1E4)), simplify=FALSE)
all.equal( rbindlist(dfs), data.table(do.call(rbind, dfs)) )
microbenchmark( DT=rbindlist(dfs), DF=do.call(rbind, dfs), times=5 )
```

## Summary

To quote Matt Dowle

`data.table` builds on base R functionality to reduce 2 types of time :

1. programming time (easier to write, read, debug and maintain)

2. compute time

It has always been that way around, 1 before 2.  The *main* benefit is the syntax: combining  where, select|update and 'by' into one query without having to string along a sequence of isolated function calls.  **Reduced function calls.  Reduced variable name repetition.  Easier to understand.**

## Databases and the Structured Query Language (SQL) 

- A database is an organized collection of datasets (tables).
- A database management system (DBMS) is a software system designed to allow the definition, creation, querying, update, and administration of databases.
- Well-known DBMSs include MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle, etc.
- Relational DBMSs (RDBMs) store data in a set of related tables
- Most RDBMs use some form of the Structured Query Language (SQL)

**Why do we even need databases?**


## The Structured Query Language (SQL) 

Although SQL is an ANSI (American National Standards Institute) standard, there are different flavors of the SQL language.

The data in RDBMS is stored in database objects called tables.

A table is a collection of related data entries and it consists of columns and rows.

Here we will use SQLite, which is a self contained relational database management system. In contrast to other database management systems, SQLite is not a separate process that is accessed from the client application (e.g. MySQL, PostgreSQL).

## Using RSQLite

Here we will make use of the [Bioconductor](http://www.bioconductor.org) project to load and use an SQLite database.

```{r eval=FALSE}
# You only need to run this once. Install if require() fails.
source("http://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")
require(org.Hs.eg.db) || biocLite("org.Hs.eg.db")
```

```{r load-Hs-library, cache=FALSE}
# Now we can use the org.Hs.eg.db to load a database
library(org.Hs.eg.db)
# Create a connection
Hs_con <- org.Hs.eg_dbconn()

```


## Using RSQLite

```{r}
# List tables
head(dbListTables(Hs_con))
# Or using an SQLite command (NOTE: This is specific to SQLite)
head(dbGetQuery(Hs_con, "SELECT name FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table' ORDER BY name;"))
```

## Using RSQLite 

```{r fields, cache=FALSE}
# What columns are available?
dbListFields(Hs_con, "gene_info")
dbListFields(Hs_con, "alias")
# Or using SQLite
# dbGetQuery(Hs_con, "PRAGMA table_info('gene_info');")
```

## Using RSQLite 

```{r select-all, cache=FALSE}
gc()
alias <- dbGetQuery(Hs_con, "SELECT * FROM alias;")
gc()
gene_info <- dbGetQuery(Hs_con, "SELECT * FROM gene_info;")
chromosomes <- dbGetQuery(Hs_con, "SELECT * FROM chromosomes;")
```

## Using RSQLite 

```{r join, cache=FALSE}
CD154_df <- dbGetQuery(Hs_con, "SELECT * FROM alias a JOIN gene_info g ON g._id = a._id WHERE a.alias_symbol LIKE 'CD154';")
gc()
CD40LG_alias_df <- dbGetQuery(Hs_con, "SELECT * FROM alias a JOIN gene_info g ON g._id = a._id WHERE g.symbol LIKE 'CD40LG';")
gc()
```

## Some SQL Commands

### SELECT

The SELECT is used to query the database and retrieve selected data that match the specific criteria that you specify:

SELECT column1 [, column2, ...] 
FROM tablename 
WHERE condition 

### ORDER BY

ORDER BY clause can order column name in either ascending (ASC) or descending (DESC) order.

## Some SQL Commands

### JOIN

There are times when we need to collate data from two or more tables. 
As with data.tables we can use LEFT/RIGHT/INNER JOINS

### GROUP BY

The GROUP BY was added to SQL so that aggregate functions could return a result grouped by column values. 

SELECT col_name, function (col_name) FROM table_name GROUP BY col_name 

## A "GROUP BY" example

```{r join-chromosome, cache=FALSE}
dbGetQuery(Hs_con, "SELECT c.chromosome, COUNT(g.gene_name) AS count FROM chromosomes c JOIN gene_info g ON g._id = c._id WHERE c.chromosome IN (1,2,3,4,'X') GROUP BY c.chromosome ORDER BY count;")
```

## Some more SQL commands

Some other SQL statements that might be of used to you:

### CREATE TABLE

The CREATE TABLE statement is used to create a new table. 

### DELETE

The DELETE command can be used to remove a record(s) from a table. 

### DROP

To remove an entire table from the database use the DROP command.

### CREATE VIEW

A view is a virtual table that is a result of SQL SELECT statement. A view contains fields from one or more real tables in the database. This virtual table can then be queried as if it were a real table. 


## Creating your own SQLite database in R

```{r sqlite-ex, cache=FALSE}
db <- dbConnect(SQLite(), dbname="./Data/SDY61/SDY61.sqlite")
dbWriteTable(conn = db, name = "hai", value = "./Data/SDY61/hai_result.txt", row.names = FALSE, header = TRUE, sep="\t", overwrite=TRUE)
dbWriteTable(conn = db, name = "cohort", value = "./Data/SDY61/arm_or_cohort.txt", row.names = FALSE, header = TRUE, sep="\t", overwrite=TRUE)
```

## Creating your own SQLite database in R 

```{r some-queries, cache=FALSE}
dbListFields(db, "hai")
dbListFields(db, "cohort")
```

## Creating your own SQLite database in R 

```{r}
res <- dbGetQuery(db, "SELECT STUDY_TIME_COLLECTED, cohort.DESCRIPTION, MAX(VALUE_REPORTED) AS max_value FROM hai JOIN cohort ON hai.ARM_ACCESSION = cohort.ARM_ACCESSION WHERE cohort.DESCRIPTION LIKE '%TIV%' GROUP BY BIOSAMPLE_ACCESSION;")

head(res)
```

## Using data.table to perform the same operations

```{r a-la-dt}
# Read the tables using fread
hai <- fread("./Data/SDY61/hai_result.txt")
cohort <- fread("./Data/SDY61/arm_or_cohort.txt")

## Set keys before joining
setkey(hai, "ARM_ACCESSION")
setkey(cohort, "ARM_ACCESSION")

## Inner join
dt_joined <- cohort[hai, nomatch=0]

## Summarize values
head(dt_joined[DESCRIPTION %like% "TIV", list(max_value=max(VALUE_REPORTED)), by="BIOSAMPLE_ACCESSION,STUDY_TIME_COLLECTED"])
```

## The sqldf package

Sometimes it can be convenient to use SQL statements on dataframes. This is exactly what the sqldf package does.


```{r sqldf, eval=FALSE}
library(sqldf)
data(iris)
sqldf("select * from iris limit 5")
sqldf("select count(*) from iris")
sqldf("select Species, count(*) from iris group by Species")
```

The `sqldf` package can even provide increased speed over pure R operations. 

## dplyr

[dplyr](https://github.com/hadley/dplyr) is a new package which provides a set of tools for efficiently manipulating datasets in R. 

- Identify the most important data manipulation tools needed for data analysis and make them easy to use from R.

- Provide blazing fast performance for in-memory data by writing key pieces in C++.

- Use the same interface to work with data no matter where it's stored, whether in a data frame, a data table or database.

## dplyr is verbose!

`dplyr` implements the following verbs useful for data manipulation:

- `select()`: focus on a subset of variables
- `filter()`: focus on a subset of rows
- `mutate()`: add new columns
- `summarise()`: reduce each group to a smaller number of summary statistics
- `arrange()`: re-order the rows

## dplyr with SQLite
```{r}
suppressMessages(library(dplyr))
my_db <- src_sqlite("./Data/SDY61/SDY61.sqlite", create = T)
hai_sql <- tbl(my_db, "hai")
```

## Select

```{r}
select(hai_sql, ARM_ACCESSION, BIOSAMPLE_ACCESSION)
```

## Filter

```{r}
filter(hai_sql, value_reported>10)
```

## Summarize

```{r}
summarize(group_by(hai_sql,SUBJECT_ACCESSION, STUDY_TIME_COLLECTED), mean(VALUE_REPORTED))
```

## dplyr on data.tables

```{r}
summarize(group_by(hai,SUBJECT_ACCESSION, STUDY_TIME_COLLECTED), mean(VALUE_REPORTED))
```

## dplyr and magrittr

dplyr can use piping operations via the [magrittr](https://github.com/smbache/magrittr) package, as follows,

```{r}
library(magrittr)
hai %>% group_by(SUBJECT_ACCESSION, STUDY_TIME_COLLECTED) %>% summarize(hai_mean=mean(VALUE_REPORTED)) %>% filter(STUDY_TIME_COLLECTED==28)
```


## Summary

- R base `data.frame`s are convenient but often not adapted to large dataset manipulation (e.g. genomics). 

- Thankfully, there are good alternatives. My recommendtion is:
    - Use `data.table` for your day-to-day operations
    - When you have many tables and a complex schema, use `sqlite`.
    
**Note:** There many other R packages for "big data" such the `bigmemory` suite, `biglm`, `ff`, `RNetcdf`, `rhdf5`, etc.
