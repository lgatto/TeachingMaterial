# What is data analysis

> Data analysis is the process by which data becomes understanding,
> knowledge and insight. Hadley Wickham

The ability to prepare and **explore** data, identify **patterns**
(good and pathological ones) and convincingly demonstrate that the
patterns are **genuine** (rather than random).

It's not analysing data, it's *investigating* data - requires flexibility.

# And also

* Reproducibility/replicability
* Automation
* Plain text: tracking, re-use, share, communicable


`Programming`,  but: 

* Learning curve (although, I would argue that the
reflecting/investigating/analysing the data is the real challenge)


# To analyse data, you need

* ~~Programming skills~~
* ~~Be a statistician/machine learner~~

# To analyse data, you need

* ~~Programming skills~~
* ~~Be a statistician/machine learner~~
* Knowledge about the domain
* Know about your data
* Be able to manipulate/visualise it
* How good do we need to be? 

# To analyse data, you need

* ~~Programming skills~~
* ~~Be a statistician/machine learner~~
* Knowledge about the domain
* Know about your data
* Be able to manipulate/visualise it
* How good do we need to be? **Good enough**

# Quantitative proteomics data analysis

* What data do we have? 
* What analyses can we apply?
* Track/check the data throughout the analysis.

# Visualisation

> Graphics reveal data.

  

> Visualization can surprise you, but it doesn’t scale well. Modeling
> scales well, but it can’t surprise you. Hadley Wickham

# Data analysis tools

should enables you to **manipulate** your data, give some guarantees
about the **integrity** of the data, support effective
**extract/subset** components of the data, **visualise** them, enable
**transformation** of the data, give access to infrastucture for
**statistical analysis**, and enable **annotation** of the data.

# Data analysis tools 

* Store data as *computational objects* (rigorously defined data
  structures): knowing where to find things
* Consistency in data structures (and conventions)
* Easily manipluate/transform/visualise these data (*Application
  programming interface*)

# The `MSnSet` class for quantitative data

<div class="double">
<p class="double-flow">
* Expression/quantitative data
* Feature meta-data
* Sample meta-data
* Dimension constrains
