# Unsupervised learning

In **unsupervised learning** (UML), no labels are provided, and the
learning algorithm focuses solelt on detecting structure in unlabelled
input data. One generally differentiates between

- **Clustering**, where the goal is to find homogeneous subgroups
  within the data; the grouping is based on distance between
  observations.
  
- **Dimensional reduction**, where the goal is to identify patterns in
  the features of the data. Dimensionality reduction is often used to
  facilitate visualisation of the data, as well as a pre-processing
  method before supervised learning.

UML presents specific challenges and benefits:
- there is no single goal in UML
- there is generally much more unlabelled data available than labelled
  data.

# k-means clustering

The k-means clustering algorithms aims at partitioning *n*
observations into a fixed number of *k* clusters. The algorithm will
find homogenous clusters. 

In R, we use

```{r, eval=FALSE}
stats::kmeans(x, centers = 3, nstart = 10)
```

where 

- `x` is a numeric data matrix
- `centers` is the pre-defined number of clusters
- the k-means algorithm has a random component and can be repeated
  `nstart` times to improve the the returened model

> Challenge:
>
> - To learn about k-means, let's use the `iris` with the sepal and
>   petal length variables only (to factilitate visualisation). Create
>   such a data matric and name it `x`

```{r solirisx, echo=FALSE}
i <- grep("Length", names(iris))
x <- iris[, i]
```

> - Run the k-means algorithm on the newly generated data `x`, save
>   the results in a new valiable `cl`, and explore its output when
>   printed.

```{r solkmcl, echo=FALSE}
cl <- kmeans(x, 3, nstart = 10)
```

> - The actual results of the algorithms, i.e. the cluster membership
>   can be accessed in the `clusters` element of the clustering result
>   output. Use it to colour the infered clusters to generate a figure
>   like shown below.

```{r solkmplot, echo=FALSE, fig.cap = "k-means algorithm on sepal and petal lengths"}
plot(x, col = cl$cluster)
```

<details>
```{r soliris, eval=FALSE}
i <- grep("Length", names(iris))
x <- iris[, i]
cl <- kmeans(x, 3, nstart = 10)
plot(x, col = cl$cluster)
```

</details>

### How does k-means work

**Initialisation**: randomly assign class membership

```{r kmworks_init, fig.cap = "k-mean random intialisation"}
init <- sample(3, nrow(x), replace = TRUE)
plot(x, col = init)
```

**Iteration**:

1. Calculate the centre of each subgroup as the average position of
   all observations is that subgroup.
2. Each observation is then assigned to the group of its nearest
   centre.
 
It's also possible to stop the algorithm after a certain number of
iterations, or once the centers move less than a certain distance.

```{r kmworks_iter, fig.width = 12, fig.cap = "k-means iteration: calculate centers (left) and assign new cluster membership (right)"}
par(mfrow = c(1, 2))
plot(x, col = init)
centres <- sapply(1:3, function(i) colMeans(x[init == i, ], ))
centres <- t(centres)
points(centres[, 1], centres[, 2], pch = 19, col = 1:3)

tmp <- dist(rbind(centres, x))
tmp <- as.matrix(tmp)[, 1:3]

ki <- apply(tmp, 1, which.min)
ki <- ki[-(1:3)]

plot(x, col = ki)
points(centres[, 1], centres[, 2], pch = 19, col = 1:3)
```

**Termination**: Repeat iteration until no point changes its cluster
membership.

### Model selection

Due to the random initialisation, one can obtain different clustering
results. When k-means is run multiple times, the best outcome,
i.e. the one that generates the smallest *total within cluster sum of
squares (SS)*, is selected. The total within SS is calculated as:

For each cluster results:

- for each observation, determine the squared euclidean distance from
  observation to centre of cluster
- sum all distances

Note that this is a **local minimum**; there is no guarantee to obtain
a global minimum.

```{r selrep, fig.width = 12, fig.cap = "Different k-means results on the same (random) data"}
cl1 <- kmeans(x, centers = 3, nstart = 10)
cl2 <- kmeans(x, centers = 3, nstart = 10)
table(cl1$cluster, cl2$cluster)

cl1 <- kmeans(x, centers = 3, nstart = 1)
cl2 <- kmeans(x, centers = 3, nstart = 1)
table(cl1$cluster, cl2$cluster)

set.seed(42)
xr <- matrix(rnorm(prod(dim(x))), ncol = ncol(x))
cl1 <- kmeans(xr, centers = 3, nstart = 1)
cl2 <- kmeans(xr, centers = 3, nstart = 1)
table(cl1$cluster, cl2$cluster)
diffres <- cl1$cluster != cl2$cluster
par(mfrow = c(1, 2))
plot(xr, col = cl1$cluster, pch = ifelse(diffres, 19, 1))
plot(xr, col = cl2$cluster, pch = ifelse(diffres, 19, 1))
```
</details>

### How to determine the number of clusters

1. Run k-means with `k=1`, `k=2`, ..., `k=n`
2. Record total within SS for each value of k.
3. Choose k at the *elbow* position, as illustrated below.

```{r kmelbow, echo=FALSE, fig.cap = ""}
ks <- 1:5
tot_within_ss <- sapply(ks, function(k) {
    cl <- kmeans(x, k, nstart = 10)
    cl$tot.withinss
})
plot(ks, tot_within_ss, type = "b",
     ylab = "Total within squared distances",
     xlab = "Values of k tested")
```

> Challenge

> Calculate the total within sum of squares for k from 1 to 5 for our
> `x` test data, and reproduce the figure above. 

<details>
```{r solkmelbow}
ks <- 1:5
tot_within_ss <- sapply(ks, function(k) {
    cl <- kmeans(x, k, nstart = 10)
    cl$tot.withinss
})
plot(ks, tot_within_ss, type = "b")
```

# Hierarchical clustering

## How does hierarchical clustering work

**Initialisation**:  Starts by assigning each of the n point its own cluster

**Iteration**

1. Find the two nearest clusters, and join them together, leading to
   n-1 clusters
2. Continue merging cluster process until all are grouped into a
   single cluster

**Termination:** All observations are grouped within a single cluster.

```{r hcldata, fig.width = 12, echo=FALSE, fig.cap = "Hierarchical clustering: initialisation (left) and colour-coded results after iteration (right)."}
set.seed(42)
xr <- data.frame(x = rnorm(5),
                 y = rnorm(5))
cls <- c("red", "blue", "orange", "blue", "orange")
cls <- scales::col2hcl(cls, alpha = 0.5)
par(mfrow = c(1, 2))
plot(xr, cex = 3)
text(xr$x, xr$y, 1:5)
plot(xr, cex = 3, col = cls, pch = 19)
text(xr$x, xr$y, 1:5)
```

The results of hierarchical clustering are typically visualised along
a **dendrogram**, where the distance between the clusters is
proportional to the branch lengths.


```{r hcldendro, echo=FALSE, fig.cap = "Visualisation of the hierarchical clustering results on a dendrogram"}
plot(hcr <- hclust(dist(xr)))
```

In R:

- Calculate the distance using `dist`, typically the Euclidean
  distance.
- Hierarchical clustering on this distance matrix using `hclust`

> Challenge
> 
> Apply hierarchical clustering on the `iris` data and generate a
> dendrogram using the dedicated `plot` method.

<details>
```{r hclsol, fig.cap = ""}
d <- dist(iris[, 1:4])
hcl <- hclust(d)
hcl
plot(hcl)
```
</details>

## Defining clusters

After producing the hierarchical clustering result, we need to *cut
the tree (dendrogram)* at a specific height to defined the
clusters. For example, on our test dataset above, we could decide to
cut it at a distance around 1.5, with would produce 2 clusters.

```{r cuthcl, echo=FALSE, fig.cap = "Cutting the dendrogram at height 1.5."}
plot(hcr)
abline(h = 1.5, col = "red")
```

In R we can us the `cutree` function to

- cut the tree at a specific height: `cutree(hcl, h = 1.5)`
- cut the tree to get a certain number of clusters: `cutree(hcl, k = 2)`

> Challenge
> 
> - Cut the iris hierarchical clustering result at a height to obtain
>   3 clusters by setting `h`.
> - Cut the iris hierarchical clustering result at a height to obtain
>   3 clusters by setting directly `k`, and verify that both provide
>   the same results.


<details>
```{r cuthclsol}
plot(hcl)
abline(h = 3.9, col = "red")
cutree(hcl, k = 3)
cutree(hcl, h = 3.9)
identical(cutree(hcl, k = 3), cutree(hcl, h = 3.9))
```
</details>


> Challenge
> 
> Using the same value `k = 3`, verify if k-means and hierarchical
> clustering produce the same results on the `iris` data.
> 
> Which one, if any, is correct?


<details>
```{r iris2algs, fig.width = 12, fig.cap = ""}
km <- kmeans(iris[, 1:4], centers = 3, nstart = 10)
hcl <- hclust(dist(iris[, 1:4]))
table(km$cluster, cutree(hcl, k = 3))
par(mfrow = c(1, 2))
plot(iris$Petal.Length, iris$Sepal.Length, col = km$cluster, main = "k-means")
plot(iris$Petal.Length, iris$Sepal.Length, col = cutree(hcl, k = 3), main = "Hierarchical clustering")
## Checking with the labels provided with the iris data
table(iris$Species, km$cluster)
table(iris$Species, cutree(hcl, k = 3))
```

# Pre-processing

Many of the machine learning methods that are regularly used are
sensitive to difference scales. This applies to unsupervised methods
as well as supervised methods, as we will see in the next chapter.
