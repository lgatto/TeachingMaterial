# Final notes 

## Other learning algorithms

#### Semi-supervised learning

The idea behind semi-supervised learning is to use labelled
observations to guide the determination of relevant structure in the
unlabelled data. The figures below described the *phenoDisco*
algorithm described
in
[Breckels *et al.* (2013)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23523639).

#### Deep learning in R

This book focuses on introductory material in R. This shouldn't
however give the impression that more modern approaches are not
available. R has plenty of activity arounds deep learning such as, for
example, the `r CRANpkg("keras")` package, an interface
to [Keras](https://keras.io), a high-level neural networks API.

See [this blog](https://blog.rstudio.com/2017/09/05/keras-for-r/) for
an introduction.

## Model performance

When investigating multi-class problems, it is could to consider
additional performance metrics. In such cases, models accuracy can
evaluated using the F1 score, where $F1 = 2 ~ \frac{precision \times
recall}{precision + recall}$, calculated as the harmonic mean of the
precision ($precision = \frac{tp}{tp+fp}$, a measure of *exactness* --
returned output is a relevant result) and recall
($recall=\frac{tp}{tp+fn}$, a measure of *completeness* -- indicating
how much was missed from the output). What we are aiming for are high
generalisation accuracy, i.e high $F1$, indicating that the marker
proteins in the test data set are consistently and correctly assigned
by the algorithms.

## Credit

Many parts of this course have been influenced by the
DataCamp's
[*Machine Learning with R* skill track](https://www.datacamp.com/tracks/machine-learning),
in particular the *Machine Learning Toolbox* (supervised learning
chapter) and the *Unsupervised Learning in R* (unsupervised learning
chapter) courses.

The very hands-on approach has also been influenced by the Software
and Data Carpentry lessons and teaching styles.
