title: Why git and github?

### Why use [git](http://git-scm.com)?

_Version control is the only reasonable way to keep track of changes_
in code, manuscripts, presentations, and data analysis projects.  I
used to make numbered tar.gz files for a project.  But exploring the
differences is difficult, to say the least.  And if you use git
properly, you'll have annotated each small change.

_Merging collaborators' changes made easy._  Have you ever had to
deal with a collaborator sending you modifications distributed across
many files, or had to deal with two people having made changes to the same
file at the same time?  Painful.  `git merge` is the answer.


### Why use [github](http://github.com)?

_Github is like facebook for programmers._  Everyone's on there. You
can look at what they're working on and easily peruse their
code and make suggestions or changes.

_It's really open source._ &ldquo;Open source&rdquo; is not so open if
you can't easily study it.  With github, all of the code is easily
inspected, as is its entire history.

_Github lowers the barriers to collaboration._  It's easy to
offer suggested changes to others' code through github.  I was able to
[fix a mistake](https://github.com/D-Programming-Language/phobos/commit/903a5e821a54a7dc5a2695e47db3abe2517742fe)
in the
[phobos library](https://github.com/D-Programming-Language/phobos) for
the [D programming language](http://dlang.org), because it's hosted on
github.  I
[fixed some problems](https://github.com/Caged/d3-tip/commit/c0117472438db94e0cf3febd45bf768ddc1bea5c)
in some very useful code developed by someone I don't know, because
it's hosted on github.

_You don't have to set up a git server._ It's surprisingly easy
[to get things set up](first_time.html).


### Peruse repositories

If you're still not sure about git and github, spend a bit of time
looking through the repositories for packages of interest to you.  For
example:

- [Hadley Wickham](http://had.co.nz)'s
  [bigvis](https://github.com/hadley/bigvis),
  [ggplot2](https://github.com/hadley/ggplot2),
  [lubridate](https://github.com/hadley/lubridate), 
  [dplyr](https://github.com/hadley/dplyr) 
  
- [Yihui Xie](http://yihui.name)'s [knitr](https://github.com/yihui/knitr)

- [Ramnath Vaidyanathan](https://github.com/ramnathv)'s [rCharts](https://github.com/ramnathv/rCharts), [rMaps](https://github.com/ramnathv/rMaps), [slidify](https://github.com/ramnathv/slidify)

- My own [R/qtl](http://github.com/kbroman/qtl)

Poke around in the files, and also the commits: 
Click the &ldquo;Commits&rdquo; tab and then click on a given commit
to see what changes were made.
