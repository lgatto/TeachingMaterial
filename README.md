**Scope:** This practical "hands-on" course in Bioinformatics for high dimensional omics will emphasize on how to use statistical methods, as well as the R programming language and the Bioconductor project, as tools to manipulate, visualize and analyze real world omics datasets. The course will be organized around the following topics:
- Introduction to computing for Bioinformatics using R: Introduction to R/RStudio, review of main data structures and tools for efficient and reproducible research, data manipulation and visualization
- Managing "big omics data" using relational databases: Overview of main database management systems (MySQL, Postgres, SQLite), and review of the Structured Query Language and main operations
- How to connect to a database from R, and alternative to databases in R (sqldf and data.table)
- How to evaluate and adjust the data for presence of "batch effect"
- Regression techniques for high throughput biomedical data: Multiple regression analysis and logistic regression, ANOVA and design of experiments
- Statistical methods for high dimensional hypothesis testing: Permutation tests, empirical Bayes and multiple comparison adjustment
- Modeling of gene expression data: Introduction to Bioconductor, and basic packages for gene expression analysis (GEOquery, Limma, DAVIDquery, etc)
- Genome-wide association studies and eQTLs; review of main packages in R/Bioconductor (e.g. rqtl)
- Overview of other high-throughput technologies (e.g. RNA-seq, ChIP-seq) and available tools in R/Bioconductor
- Data integration: Using R to integrate multiple data types and perform "systems biology" type analysis
- Drawbacks and limitations of high dimensional omics analysis (overfitting, inference)
