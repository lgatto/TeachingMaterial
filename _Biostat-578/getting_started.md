### Getting Started

Here is a quick list of things to do to get started, ideally before the first class:
- Install [R](http://cran.r-project.org/) and [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/). Here are a few example videos on how to do this such as [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eD07NznguA4) (for windows). Many other videos are available (search for "install RStudio" in [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/).
**Make sure that you are downloading the latest version of R (version 3.1 or above) and RStudio.**

- Install all required packages by using the script provided by Brian High. Simply typing 
```r 
source("installallpkgs.R")
``` 
in the R console should work. As an alternative you can also also click on the `source` button in RStudio. This will ensure that you have all necessary packages to reproduce the lecture notes.

- If you have never used R before, please have a look at the following material and links from Rstudio: http://www.rstudio.com/resources/training/online-learning/. In particular, you should go through the following R tutorial: http://tryr.codeschool.com/ and/or the R course provided by DataCamp: https://www.datacamp.com/. You can also look at the R package `swirl`, which provides an interactive introduction to R. The [swirl website](http://swirlstats.com/students.html), also provides basic information on how to get started with R and in particular install R and RStudio. 

- Familiarize yourself with [Bioconductor](http://www.bioconductor.org). Bioconductor has a [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/bioconductor), which provides many useful screencasts. 

- Familiarize yourself with Git and GitHub. Here is a nice YouTube playlist on git and [GitHub](github.com): https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5-da3qGB5IBLMp7LtN8Nc3Efd4hJq0kD. You might also want to look at [this](https://guides.github.com/) for a good (and lightweight) overview of GitHub.

- Install the GitHub client for [windows](https://windows.github.com/) or [mac](https://mac.github.com/). If you're using linux/unix, I assume that you know what you're doing and don't need this. RStudio also provide an integrated git client. We will discuss this in class.
